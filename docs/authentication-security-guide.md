# Authentication and Security Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the authentication and security mechanisms implemented in the GlimmerGlow application. It covers the authentication flow, security features, best practices, and recommendations for maintaining a secure system.

## Authentication Architecture

The authentication system is built on a multi-layered security approach:

1. **JWT-based Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, stateless authentication
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission system based on user roles
3. **Supabase Integration**: Leveraging Supabase for user management and authentication
4. **Token Management**: Secure handling of access and refresh tokens
5. **CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery prevention mechanisms
6. **Security Logging**: Comprehensive logging of authentication events

## Authentication Flow

### Registration Flow

1. User submits registration form with email and password
2. Server validates password strength and email format
3. Password is securely hashed and stored in Supabase
4. Confirmation email is sent to verify the user's email address
5. User account is created with default 'user' role
6. Authentication event is logged

### Login Flow

1. User submits login credentials
2. Server validates credentials against Supabase
3. If valid, server generates:
   - Access token (short-lived, 1 hour)
   - Refresh token (longer-lived, 7 days)
4. Tokens are returned to the client
5. Client stores tokens securely in session storage
6. Authentication event is logged

### Token Refresh Flow

1. Client detects when access token is about to expire
2. Client sends refresh token to server
3. Server validates refresh token
4. If valid, server generates new access and refresh tokens
5. Old tokens are invalidated
6. New tokens are returned to client
7. Token refresh event is logged

### Logout Flow

1. Client sends logout request with refresh token
2. Server blacklists the access token
3. Server invalidates the refresh token
4. Client clears stored tokens
5. Logout event is logged

## Security Features

### Password Security

1. **Minimum Requirements**:
   - At least 10 characters long
   - Must include uppercase and lowercase letters
   - Must include at least one number
   - Must include at least one special character

2. **Password Reset**:
   - Secure token-based password reset
   - Limited-time validity (1 hour)
   - Single-use tokens
   - Email delivery of reset links

### Token Security

1. **Access Tokens**:
   - Short lifespan (1 hour)
   - Contains user ID, role, and permissions
   - Signed with server-side secret
   - Includes token fingerprinting data

2. **Refresh Tokens**:
   - Longer lifespan (7 days)
   - Stored in secure database table
   - Can be invalidated server-side
   - Single-use (each use generates a new refresh token)

3. **Token Fingerprinting**:
   - Tokens are bound to IP address and user agent
   - Prevents token theft and replay attacks
   - Suspicious token usage is logged and tokens are invalidated

### CSRF Protection

1. **Token-based Protection**:
   - CSRF tokens required for all state-changing operations
   - Tokens delivered via both cookies and headers
   - Validated on every request

2. **Same-Site Cookies**:
   - Authentication cookies use SameSite=Strict
   - Prevents cross-site request attacks

### Rate Limiting

1. **Login Attempts**:
   - Maximum 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes
   - Exponential backoff for repeated failures
   - IP-based tracking with logging

2. **Password Reset**:
   - Limited to 3 requests per email address per hour
   - Prevents email flooding attacks

### Secure Headers

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
   - Restricts resource loading to trusted sources
   - Prevents XSS attacks

2. **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**:
   - Forces HTTPS connections
   - Prevents downgrade attacks

## Role-Based Access Control

### Role Hierarchy

The system implements a hierarchical role structure:

1. **Admin**: Full system access
2. **Manager**: Access to manage users and content
3. **Staff**: Limited administrative access
4. **User**: Standard user access

### Permission Model

Permissions are assigned based on roles:

1. **Resource-based permissions**: Control access to specific resources
2. **Action-based permissions**: Control ability to perform specific actions
3. **Ownership-based permissions**: Control access to user-owned resources

## Security Logging and Monitoring

### Authentication Events

The following events are logged:

1. User registration
2. Successful login
3. Failed login attempts
4. Password changes
5. Password reset requests
6. Token refreshes
7. Logout events
8. Suspicious activities

### Log Format

Each log entry includes:

1. Timestamp
2. User ID (if available)
3. Event type
4. IP address
5. User agent
6. Success/failure status
7. Additional context-specific data

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never store sensitive data in client-side code**
2. **Always validate input on both client and server**
3. **Use the authentication middleware for protected routes**
4. **Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive information**
5. **Keep dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities**

### For Administrators

1. **Regularly review authentication logs for suspicious activity**
2. **Implement proper user offboarding procedures**
3. **Enforce strong password policies**
4. **Consider implementing multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations**
5. **Regularly rotate JWT signing secrets**

## Recent Security Improvements

1. **Enhanced Token Security**:
   - Added token fingerprinting
   - Implemented token blacklisting
   - Reduced token lifetimes

2. **Improved Password Security**:
   - Strengthened password requirements
   - Enhanced password reset flow
   - Added brute force protection

3. **CSRF Protection**:
   - Implemented double-submit cookie pattern
   - Added CSRF token validation middleware

4. **Security Logging**:
   - Added comprehensive event logging
   - Improved suspicious activity detection

5. **Client-Side Security**:
   - Secure token storage in session storage
   - Automatic token refresh mechanism
   - Proper token cleanup on logout

## Future Security Roadmap

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - SMS-based verification
   - Authenticator app support
   - Recovery codes

2. **Advanced Threat Detection**:
   - Anomaly detection for login patterns
   - Geographic-based login alerts
   - Device fingerprinting

3. **Enhanced Audit Logging**:
   - User session tracking
   - Admin action logging
   - Exportable security reports

## Conclusion

Security is an ongoing process that requires vigilance and continuous improvement. This authentication system implements industry best practices to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access, but should be regularly reviewed and updated as new security threats emerge.
