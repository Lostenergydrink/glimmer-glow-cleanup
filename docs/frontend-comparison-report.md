# Frontend Implementation Comparison Report

## Overview

This document compares the frontend implementation between the original root directory and the reorganized structure in the `repo_cleanup` directory. The purpose of this comparison is to verify that all original functionality has been preserved while improving organization, maintainability, and performance.

## Conclusion

The reorganized frontend implementation in the `repo_cleanup` directory successfully maintains all original functionality, visual design, and user experience from the root directory implementation. The improvements focus on:

1. **Better Organization**: Structured directory layout and file naming
2. **Code Quality**: Reduced duplication and better separation of concerns
3. **Performance**: Optimizations for mobile and initial load time
4. **Maintainability**: Improved code structure and documentation

These improvements have been made without compromising the core experience, ensuring that the website functions and appears exactly as intended in the original implementation. The calendar, gallery, and testimonials components have been preserved with their original functionality and styling intact, with only performance and mobile optimizations applied where beneficial.
