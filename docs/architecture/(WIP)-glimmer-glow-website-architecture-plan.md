# Glimmer Glow Website - Architecture Plan

## System Overview

The Glimmer Glow Website is a business website for a relative's business, currently hosted in a GitHub repository. The project appears to be a mix of HTML, CSS, JavaScript files with various components related to a shop, testimonials, user authentication, and other business functionality. The codebase requires reorganization, standardization, and improved structure to ensure better maintainability and extensibility.

### Current Architecture Assessment

Based on the repository analysis, the current system has:

- Flat file structure with minimal organization
- Mix of HTML, CSS, JavaScript without clear separation
- Multiple empty or potentially unused files
- Custom components for UI elements
- Backend functionality for admin, shop, and contact management
- Integration with Supabase for data storage and authentication
- Environmental configuration files (.env)

## Design Decisions

### Architecture Patterns

We will implement a clear separation of concerns architecture with:

1. **Frontend Layer**:
   - HTML templates and pages
   - CSS stylesheets and themes
   - Client-side JavaScript functionality

2. **Backend Layer**:
   - Server-side JavaScript (Node.js)
   - API endpoints and services
   - Data models and business logic

3. **Data Layer**:
   - Integration with Supabase
   - Data models and schemas
   - Authentication and authorization

```

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT
- **Deployment**: [To be determined]

### Code Organization Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Separate structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JS)
   - Create modular components for reusable UI elements

2. **Consistent Naming Conventions**:
   - kebab-case for HTML, CSS files
   - camelCase for JavaScript files and variables
   - PascalCase for component names

3. **Code Modularity**:
   - Break functionality into smaller, reusable modules
   - Implement proper import/export patterns

## Implementation Guidelines

### Migration Strategy

1. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Document all current functionality
   - Map dependencies between files
   - Identify essential vs. redundant code

2. **Restructuring Phase**:
   - Create new directory structure
   - Move files to appropriate locations
   - Update references between files

3. **Clean-up Phase**:
   - Remove unused/duplicate code
   - Standardize coding patterns
   - Implement consistent error handling

4. **Documentation Phase**:
   - Update READMEs
   - Add code comments where necessary
   - Document architecture decisions

### Supabase Integration

- Move authentication logic to dedicated modules
- Standardize database access patterns
- Ensure proper security measures for API calls
- Implement proper error handling for database operations
- Use environment variables for configuration

### Security Considerations

- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication
- Implement input validation on all user inputs
- Protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
- Secure sensitive configuration in environment variables
- Implement proper role-based access control

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test individual components and functions
   - Ensure proper error handling

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify API endpoints function correctly

3. **UI/UX Tests**:
   - Test responsive design across devices
   - Verify accessibility compliance

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Local development setup
   - Development Supabase instance

2. **Staging Environment**:
   - Mimics production for testing
   - Pre-release validation

3. **Production Environment**:
   - Live website deployment
   - Monitoring and analytics

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**:
   - Component-based architecture for easier feature additions
   - Performance optimization for larger data sets

2. **Technology Evolution**:
   - Potential migration to a more comprehensive framework
   - Integration with additional services as needed

3. **Maintenance Strategy**:
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Code reviews for new features
   - Documentation updates

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Analysis and Preparation** (Week 1)
   - Repository analysis
   - Document current functionality
   - Set up development environment

2. **Phase 2: Core Restructuring** (Week 2-3)
   - Implement new directory structure
   - Migrate files
   - Update references

3. **Phase 3: Feature Consolidation** (Week 4)
   - Clean up redundant code
   - Standardize patterns
   - Implement missing functionality

4. **Phase 4: Testing and Deployment** (Week 5)
   - Implement tests
   - Set up deployment pipeline
   - Final review and launch

## Conclusion

This architecture plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for restructuring and improving the Glimmer Glow Website. By implementing a clear separation of concerns, consistent code organization, and proper integration with Supabase, we can create a maintainable and extensible codebase that will serve the business needs effectively.
