# REORGANIZATION TRACKER - GLIMMER GLOW WEBSITE

**⚠️ CRITICAL NOTE: THIS REORGANIZATION MAINTAINS ALL ORIGINAL FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS. We are reorganizing implementation approaches, not removing required features. The goal is more efficient implementation while preserving ALL required functionality. Any changes to implementation methods (such as using embedded Facebook reviews that already exist instead of building a custom system) MUST ensure the original functional requirements are still fully met. ⚠️**

**⚠️ CRITICAL NOTE: This reorganization tracker documents changes and progress specific to the @repo_cleanup directory. All file paths, changes, and documentation reference the reorganized codebase structure in @repo_cleanup. This tracker should NOT be used for the original codebase directory. ⚠️**



## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DOCUMENTATION GUIDELINES ⚠️

**All reorganization documentation MUST include comprehensive details to ensure consistency and clarity:**

1. **Complete step-by-step instructions** for any process that needs to be repeated
2. **Explicit file paths** for all referenced files, including both source and destination
3. **Detailed explanation of changes** made to each file, not just "moved" or "updated"
4. **Command examples** for any CLI operations used
5. **Dependencies and prerequisites** clearly stated at the beginning of each task
6. **Common error scenarios and solutions** documented when encountered
7. **Cross-references to related documentation** when relevant

**Remember:** Thorough documentation saves time during implementation and future maintenance. Vague instructions lead to repeated work and unnecessary troubleshooting.

  - What to check on each page (styling, JavaScript, images, links)
  - How to stop the server when testing is complete

## Current Task: Testing Pages

### Test Plan
- Use `test-pages.sh` script to start the server
- Test each page in a browser:
  - Home/Admin page: http://localhost:3001/
  - Shop page: http://localhost:3001/shop
  - Contact page: http://localhost:3001/contact
  - About Us page: http://localhost:3001/about-us
  - Private Party page: http://localhost:3001/book-a-private-party
  - Login page: http://localhost:3001/login
  - Testimonials page: http://localhost:3001/testimonials
- Check for:
  - Proper styling (CSS references working)
  - JavaScript functionality (JS references working)
  - Images displaying correctly
  - Links between pages working
- Document any issues found and fix them

### 2024-03-23: Testing Implementation and Script Creation

  - Prompts for documenting issues after testing

#### Testing Procedure
1. Run `./test-pages.sh` from the project root directory

3. Open each page URL in a browser (listed in the script output)
4. Check each page for styling, JavaScript, images, and links
5. Document any issues found
6. Press Ctrl+C to stop the server when testing is complete

#### Phase 3 Preparation
- Created analysis scripts to facilitate Phase 3 (Code Cleanup and Standardization):
  - `find-empty-files.sh`: Identifies empty or near-empty files that are candidates for removal
    - Detects truly empty files (0 bytes)
    - Identifies near-empty files (1-50 bytes)
    - Finds HTML files with just boilerplate content
    - Locates potentially duplicate files with identical content
  - `analyze-css.sh`: Analyzes CSS files for duplication and consolidation opportunities
    - Counts CSS files by directory
    - Identifies most common CSS properties
    - Finds duplicate or similar CSS rules across files
    - Analyzes CSS file sizes to prioritize refactoring
    - Checks for vendor prefix usage
  - `analyze-js.sh`: Analyzes JavaScript files for refactoring opportunities
    - Counts JavaScript files by directory
    - Analyzes file sizes to prioritize refactoring
    - Finds potentially duplicated function names
    - Identifies small functions that could be moved to utilities
    - Analyzes DOM manipulation patterns for standardization
    - Examines event listener usage
    - Reviews AJAX/fetch patterns

## Next Steps

   - Consider adding more recent reviews if available
2. Fix remaining skipped tests for contact form validation
3. Complete documentation updates
4. Proceed with Phase 5 testing and deployment preparation

### 2025-03-21: Empty File Removal

#### Empty Files Removed
- Removed the following empty files from the root directory:
  - `./preview.html`: Empty file with no actual references in the codebase
  - `./testimonials.html`: Empty file that was intended as a separate page but replaced by a section in index.html
  - `./device-preview.css`: Empty CSS file with no active references
  - `./primary-glow-effect.css`: Empty CSS file with only a commented-out reference in index.html

#### Server Route Updates
- Updated the `/testimonials` route in `repo_cleanup/server/server.js`:
  - Changed from: `res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../pages/testimonials.html'));`
  - To: `res.redirect('/#testimonials-section');`
  - This change ensures that the URL `/testimonials` continues to work by redirecting users to the testimonials section in the index page

## Backend Implementation Progress

### 2023-05-15: Hybrid Database Architecture Implemented

The robust hybrid architecture for database interactions has been successfully implemented in the repo_cleanup version. This architecture provides the following benefits:

- **Resilience**: The system now uses Supabase as the primary database provider with a fallback to direct PostgreSQL connections when needed.
- **Abstraction**: A clean DatabaseProvider interface has been created that allows for easy addition of new database providers without affecting the rest of the application.
- **Structure**: The backend now follows a clear structure with controllers, routes, middleware, and database access layers.

Components implemented:
- Database Provider Interface
- Supabase Implementation
- PostgreSQL Implementation
- Provider Factory with Fallback Mechanism
- Connection Management
- Initial API Routes

The hybrid architecture ensures that we maintain all the original functionality while providing a more maintainable and flexible structure for future development.

Next steps:
- Complete the authentication controllers and routes
- Implement the orders API
- Set up user profile functionality
- Integrate frontend with the new API structure
