# Contact and Facebook Reviews Integration DEBUG 1.0

**⚠️ CRITICAL NOTE: This debugging log is part of the repository restructuring project. The functional requirements remain unchanged - we are simply implementing them in a more efficient way by recognizing that testimonials are already implemented as embedded Facebook reviews rather than requiring a custom submission system. All original functionality requirements must still be met. ⚠️**

## Key Discovery
We discovered that testimonials for the GlimmerGlow website are implemented as embedded Facebook reviews rather than as a custom testimonial submission system. This led to a significant simplification of the implementation by:

1. Removing unnecessary database tables and SQL scripts
2. Simplifying the contact form to use email notification only
3. Focusing effort on optimizing the existing Facebook reviews carousel
4. Improving documentation to reflect the actual implementation
5. Creating a cleaner solution that matches the actual requirements
