# Glimmer Glow Website - Task List

**⚠️ CRITICAL NOTE: THIS TASK LIST MAINTAINS ALL ORIGINAL FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS. When reorganizing implementation approaches (such as using embedded Facebook reviews that already exist instead of building a custom system), we are NOT removing required features. The goal is more efficient implementation while preserving ALL required functionality. Any changes to how features are implemented MUST ensure the original functional requirements are still fully met. ⚠️**

**⚠️ CRITICAL NOTE: This task list is specific to and should be executed within the @repo_cleanup directory. All paths and tasks reference the reorganized codebase structure in @repo_cleanup. DO NOT execute these tasks in the original codebase directory. ⚠️**
