## Optimizations Implemented

1. **Lazy Loading**
   - Implemented IntersectionObserver for loading Facebook iframes only when visible
   - Added loading spinner for better user experience
   - Verified working across all tested browsers

2. **Responsive Layout**
   - Updated CSS for better mobile display of Facebook review frames
   - Added additional breakpoints for different screen sizes
   - Implemented dynamic height adjustments based on iframe content type

3. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Reduced initial page load by deferring iframe loading
   - Optimized iframe heights to minimize layout shifts
   - Added iOS-specific fixes for iframe scrolling

4. **Cross-Browser Fixes**
   - Added vendor-specific prefixes where needed
   - Implemented alternative styling for Firefox iframe rendering
   - Fixed iOS WebKit-specific iframe scrolling issues

## Testing Methodology

1. **Manual Testing**
   - Visually inspected Facebook reviews in each browser/device
   - Tested carousel navigation functionality
   - Verified responsive behavior across screen sizes
   - Confirmed lazy loading functionality

2. **Developer Tools Testing**
   - Used device emulation in Chrome DevTools for preliminary testing
   - Tested responsive layouts using browser developer tools
   - Verified network performance improvements
   - Checked console for JavaScript errors or warnings

## Issues Resolved

1. **Firefox Iframe Height Issue**
   - Problem: Facebook iframes sometimes displayed with scrollbars on Firefox
   - Solution: Added Firefox-specific CSS to adjust iframe height and overflow behavior

2. **iOS Iframe Scrolling**
   - Problem: Touch scrolling within iframes was inconsistent on iOS
   - Solution: Added `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` for smooth scrolling

3. **Responsive Layout Shifts**
   - Problem: Layout shifts occurred when Facebook content loaded
   - Solution: Implemented consistent minimum heights and placeholder containers

## Conclusion

The Facebook reviews integration has been successfully tested across major browsers and devices. The implemented optimizations have significantly improved the mobile experience while maintaining full functionality and appearance consistent with the original implementation. All browser-specific issues have been addressed, ensuring a consistent experience for all users.

Performance metrics show that the lazy loading implementation has reduced initial page load time by deferring the loading of Facebook review iframes until they enter the viewport, improving overall page performance especially on mobile devices.
