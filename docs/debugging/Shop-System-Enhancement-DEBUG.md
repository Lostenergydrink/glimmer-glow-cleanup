# (WIP)-Shop-System-Enhancement-DEBUG.md

## Issue Overview
- **Problem Statement**: Task 4.2 in the GlimmerGlow website reorganization requires enhancing the shop system functionality. The current implementation needs review, standardization of product management, enhancement of the shopping cart functionality, and comprehensive testing of the purchase flow.
- **Error Messages/Stack Traces**: No specific errors identified yet, but potential inconsistencies between the front-end shop implementation and the server-side database integration need to be addressed.
- **Occurrence Patterns**: N/A
- **System Impact Scope**: The shop system is a core functionality of the website, affecting product display, shopping cart, checkout process, and user purchases.
- **Reproduction Steps**: N/A
- **Initial Symptoms**: The shop system works, but lacks standardized database integration, consistent UI patterns, and may have challenges with the checkout flow.

## Context & Environment
- **Last Known Good State**: The current implementation uses a combination of local storage and file-based data management, with incomplete Supabase integration.
- **Recent Codebase Changes**: 
  - Completed Task 4.1: Admin Features
  - Reorganized directory structure (Phase 2)
  - Consolidated JavaScript files with utilities.js
  - Enhanced security with improved authentication, CSRF protection, and input validation
- **System Configuration**: 
  - Node.js Express server
  - Supabase for database
  - Local file storage as fallback
  - Client-side shop UI with cart and wishlist functionality
- **Version Information**: 
  - Current project state: Phase 4 (Feature Implementation) in progress
  - Completed: Phase 1-3, Task 4.1
- **Dependency Chain**: 
  - shop.js depends on utilities.js, cart.js, cart-ui.js, and wishlist.js
  - Server-side shop endpoints depend on shop-models.js
  - shop-models.js depends on utilities-node.js and file-lock.js
- **Relevant Logs/Metrics**: N/A
- **User Reports**: N/A

## Investigation Plan
- **Working Theories**:
  1. The shop system needs to fully transition from file-based storage to Supabase
  2. Shopping cart functionality needs synchronization between local storage and database
  3. Checkout process needs standardization and enhanced error handling
  4. Product management needs consistent CRUD operations

- **Debug Methodology**:
  1. Review current shop implementation in detail
  2. Map current functionality against best practices
  3. Identify improvements needed for standardization
  4. Implement and test enhancements incrementally

- **Test Scenarios**:
  1. Test product loading from Supabase
  2. Test shopping cart operations (add, remove, update, clear)
  3. Test checkout process with mock payments
  4. Test wishlist functionality
  5. Test user authentication integration with cart synchronization

- **Diagnostic Tools**:
  1. Browser developer tools for front-end testing
  2. Supabase dashboard for database verification
  3. Server logs for backend operation verification
  4. Custom test scripts to verify shop operations

- **Data Collection Needs**:
  1. Current database schema for products, cart, orders
  2. API endpoint documentation
  3. User flow diagrams for the shopping experience

- **Success Criteria**:
  1. All product management operations use Supabase database
  2. Shopping cart persists between sessions and for logged-in users
  3. Checkout process handles errors gracefully
  4. All UI operations maintain consistent state

## Timeline Log
```
2024-06-12 10:00 [Starting Investigation]
- Reviewed current shop implementation files
- Analyzed directory structure and component relationships
- Identified key files: shop.js, cart.js, cart-ui.js, wishlist.js, shop-models.js
- Found existing Supabase integration in database.service.js but not fully utilized by shop system
- Discovered disconnect between client-side cart implementation and server-side database operations

2024-06-12 11:30 [Database Service Analysis]
- Analyzed database.service.js to identify existing shop-related methods
- Found methods for products (CRUD), transactions, and subscriptions
- Identified missing methods for:
  - Shopping cart management (saveCart, loadCart, mergeCart)
  - Wishlist management (saveWishlist, loadWishlist)
  - Order management (createOrder, getOrders, getOrderDetails)
  - Category management (getCategories, getCategoryProducts)
  - Payment processing integration
- Noted inconsistency between database column naming (snake_case in database vs camelCase in JavaScript)
- Determined need for data transformation layer between database and application

2024-04-10 10:15 [Progress]
- Analyzed database.service.js to identify missing functionality for shop system
- Discovered gaps in database service implementation for cart and order management
- Found no standardized data transformation between database and application
- Noted inconsistencies in column naming conventions
- Need to implement missing methods and data transformation

2024-04-10 11:30 [Implementation]
- Implemented comprehensive shop-related database methods in database.service.js:
  - Shopping Cart functions: saveCart, loadCart, clearCart
  - Wishlist functions: saveWishlist, loadWishlist
  - Order Management functions: createOrder, getUserOrders, getOrderById, updateOrderStatus
  - Enhanced Category Management: getCategories, getProductsByCategory, createCategory, updateCategory, deleteCategory
- Added data transformation utilities to handle snake_case to camelCase conversion:
  - transformDatabaseFields: Converts database fields (snake_case) to JavaScript fields (camelCase)
  - transformJavaScriptFields: Converts JavaScript fields (camelCase) to database fields (snake_case)
- Ensured proper error handling and logging throughout all methods
- Incorporated consistent patterns for database operations
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments for improved code maintainability

Next steps:
1. Update client-side cart.js to use the new database service methods
2. Ensure the shop-models.js file integrates with these new methods
3. Implement the API routes in server.js to expose these methods to the frontend
4. Update the shop pages to use the enhanced functionality
5. Test the complete purchase flow

2024-04-10 13:45 [Implementation]
- Created a comprehensive client-side shop service (shop.service.js) to interact with the server:
  - Implemented methods for product management: getProducts, getProductById, getProductsByCategory
  - Added cart management functions: saveCart, loadCart, clearCart, addToCart, removeFromCart, updateCartItemQuantity
  - Added wishlist management: saveWishlist, loadWishlist, addToWishlist, removeFromWishlist
  - Implemented order management: createOrder, getUserOrders, getOrderById
  - Added checkout processing functionality
- Created server-side shop routes (shop.routes.js) with comprehensive endpoints:
  - Product routes: GET /products, GET /products/:id
  - Category routes: GET /categories, GET /categories/:id/products
  - Cart routes: GET/POST/DELETE /cart, POST/DELETE/PUT /cart/items
  - Wishlist routes: GET/POST /wishlist, POST/DELETE /wishlist/items
  - Order routes: GET /orders, GET /orders/:id, POST /orders
  - Checkout route: POST /checkout
- Implemented validation schemas (shop.schemas.js) for all API requests:
  - Product validation
  - Category validation
  - Cart item validation
  - Wishlist validation
  - Order and shipping address validation
  - Checkout and payment validation
- Updated server.js to incorporate the new shop routes
- Used proper middleware for authentication and validation
- Ensured consistent error handling across all routes
- Added data transformation between database and API layer

Next steps:

2. Implement client-side cart synchronization (local storage + database)
3. Create unified shopping cart experience that works for both authenticated and anonymous users
4. Add wishlist UI components
5. Implement checkout flow UI
6. Add tests for the new functionality
7. Document the shop system architecture
