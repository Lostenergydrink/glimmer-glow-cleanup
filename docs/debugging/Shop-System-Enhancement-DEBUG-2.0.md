# Shop System Enhancement DEBUG 2.0

## Issue Overview
**Problem Statement**: Enhancing the shop system with improved architecture and MCP integration
**System Impact Scope**: Shop system core functionality including:
- Product management
- Shopping cart
- Checkout process
- Database integration
- User authentication flow

## Context & Environment
**Current State**:
- Shop system partially implemented
- Mixed storage (local storage + file-based + Supabase)
- Incomplete database integration
- Non-standardized API patterns

**Recent Changes**:
- Completed directory restructuring
- Consolidated JavaScript utilities
- Enhanced security measures
- Improved authentication

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis
1. Map current shop system components
2. Identify integration points with Supabase
3. Document API patterns
4. Review client-side state management

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. Standardize database operations
2. Implement consistent API patterns
3. Enhance shopping cart synchronization
4. Improve checkout flow
5. Add comprehensive error handling

### Phase 3: Testing
1. Unit tests for shop operations
2. Integration tests for database
3. End-to-end purchase flow testing
4. Security testing for checkout
