# CSS Duplication Removal Summary

## Date: 2025-03-21
## Project: GlimmerGlow Website
## Phase: Phase 3 - Code Cleanup and Standardization

### Overview

Identified and removed CSS duplications from page-specific CSS files. These styles were already present in:
- `styles/global/global.css` - Common styles, reset, utilities, vendor prefixes
- `styles/components/modal.css` - Modal styles
- `styles/components/calendar.css` - Calendar styles

### Removed Duplications

1. **Gradient Text Styles**
   - Removed duplicate gradient text styles that use the same color pattern
   - Added comments instructing to use `.gradient-text` class from global.css

2. **Flex Utility Patterns**
   - Removed duplicate flex display patterns
   - Added comments instructing to use utility classes (`.flex`, `.flex-column`, etc.)

3. **Vendor Prefixes**
   - Removed duplicate vendor prefixes that are already normalized in global.css
   - Primarily focused on `-webkit-background-clip` and `-webkit-text-fill-color`

4. **Scrollbar Styling**
   - Removed page-specific scrollbar styling duplicating global scrollbar styles
   - This standardizes scrollbar appearance across all pages

5. **Modal Styles**
   - Removed duplicate modal styles that are now in components/modal.css
   - This ensures consistent modal styling across all pages

### Impact

- Reduced redundancy in CSS files
- Improved maintainability by centralizing common styles
- Encouraged use of utility classes for consistency
- Made it easier to update styles globally with fewer places to change

### Next Steps

- Test pages with updated CSS files to ensure styling remains consistent
- Update HTML files to use utility classes where appropriate
- Consider creating additional component CSS files for buttons and other recurring elements
